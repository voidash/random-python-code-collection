#class attribute : defined outside __init__ and accessible to all the methods in the class
#variable that belongs to class as a whole rather than a specific instance


#instance attribute: variable specific to that particular instance only


class Foo(object):
  wage_increase = 10  #acts like class attribute

  def __init__(self,x,y):
    self.x=x    #acts like instance attribute
    self.y=y
    
  


#attributes of the object can be accessed by dir()
i=123
len(dir(i))
#64
dir(i)[:5] 
#['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__class__', '__cmp__']
